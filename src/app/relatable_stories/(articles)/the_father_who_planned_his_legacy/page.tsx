            <img src={articleItem.image}></img>
            <p>Meet <b>Mang Ramon</b>, a successful businessman in his 50s. He worked hard all his life — from selling in palengke, to running his own construction supply business.</p>
            <p>After 30 years, he built a good life for his family. He had <b>three houses, two vehicles, a few investments,</b> and <b>five children</b> — four from his marriage, and one from a previous relationship.</p>
            <p style={{textIndent: '0'}}>He loved them all equally. ❤️</p>
            <div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', textAlign: 'left'}}>But deep inside, he worried…</p>
                <p>“What if pag nawala na ako, mag-away pa sila dahil sa mana?”</p>
                <p>He’s seen it happen to many families — siblings turning against each other, properties frozen because no one could agree, and wealth slowly wasted because of conflict and lack of planning.</p>
            </div>

            <hr/>
            <HeadlineComponent emojiImg="emoji_u1f9fe.png" text="The Father’s Smart Move" />
            <p>Instead of just writing a will, <b>Mang Ramon talked to his financial wealth planner</b> and learned something life-changing — that <b>life insurance can be used as a wealth transfer tool</b>.</p>
            <div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', textAlign: 'left'}}>With it, he can decide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li className="italic"><SpanEmoji value="&#x2705;&#xFE0F;"/> Sino ang makakatanggap,</li>
                    <li className="italic"><SpanEmoji value="&#x2705;&#xFE0F;"/> Magkano ang makukuha ng bawat isa,</li>
                    <li className="italic"><SpanEmoji value="&#x2705;&#xFE0F;"/> At paano nila ito matatanggap.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>So he got an insurance policy — not just for protection, but to make sure <b>his wealth goes exactly where his heart wants it to go</b>.</p>
            <div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', textAlign: 'left'}}>He also made a wise decision:</p>
                <p>Since one of his five children was an <i>illegitimate child</i>, he wanted to make sure that this child <b>still receives his fair share</b> — without legal complications or arguments from the other siblings.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Through his insurance, he named all his children as beneficiaries — including the one outside of marriage — and <b>assigned a trustee</b> to manage the money on behalf of all of them.</p>

            <div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', textAlign: 'left'}}>He also told his wealth planner:</p>
                <div className="border-l-4 border-l-gray-500 pl-5">
                    <p style={{textIndent: '0'}}>“Ayokong bigyan sila ng isang bagsak na pera. Gusto ko, buwan-buwan nilang maramdaman na andito pa rin ako.”</p>
                </div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0'}}>So, instead of giving them a lump sum,</p>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0'}}>he arranged the proceeds to be distributed as <b>monthly allowances</b> — just like how he used to provide for them when he was alive.</p>

            <div>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0'}}>The trustee’s job?</p>

                <p>His children grieved, but they were not burdened by paperwork, taxes, or family conflict.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Because of his plan, <b>there was no fighting, no “away sa mana.” </b>Each child knew their father had already made the decision — and they respected it.</p>
            <p>Now, <b>18 years after his passing</b>, his children still receive their monthly allowance — money that keeps coming, like their father’s love that never stopped giving. 💛</p>
